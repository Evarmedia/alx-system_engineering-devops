# 0x15. API

# API

This project was further practice in working with API's. I collected data from the
[JSONPlaceholder REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), and learned how
to export it to either CSV or JSON format.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Gather data from an API**

* **1. Export to CSV**

* **2. Export to JSON**

* **3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries**
